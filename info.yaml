# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Harry Snell"      # Your name
  title:        "PDM driver"      # Project title
  description:  "5-bit pulse density modulation encoder (aka sigma-delta converter)" # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The pdm_input is registered when write_en is high. The registered input is added to an accummulator on each cycle. The overflow bit of the sum is pdm_output." # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set reset low and write_en high, provide a clock (frequency not important) and put a 5-bit number on pdm_input and see how the average value on pdm_out changes" # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Clock source, switches for input. LED, RC circuit, logic analyser or oscilloscope to view output" # Describe any external hardware needed
  doc_link:     "https://github.com/H-S-S-11/tinytapeout-verilog-test/blob/main/README.md" # URL to longer form documentation (README.md in repository)
  clock_hz:     200 # Clock frequency in Hz - arbitrary choice. Can go higher.
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
